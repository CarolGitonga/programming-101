"""
Sometimes records of a file are not one per line. Records of a file may cross multiple
lines like in drawing2.txt. In that case, you canâ€™t use a for loop to read the file. You need a while loop
instead. When you use a while loop, you need to be able to check a condition to see
if you are done reading the file. But, to check the condition you must first try to read
at least a little of a record. Computer programmers have a name for this problem
as it relates to reading from files. It is called the Loop and a Half Pattern. To use a
while loop to read from a file, we need a loop and a half. The half comes before the
while loop.
